# Project Xanadu – The Master Plan  

"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree…"  

## A Game Design Document for the Xanadu Live Prototype
Project Xanadu is a surreal utopia-building game inspired by the iconic (and unfinished) public-domain poem.  
Players sculpt smooth voxel terrain, recruit strange creatures, and build a thriving pleasure dome with a customizable V.A.N. (Vehicular Actualization Navigator).

## Potential Titles
- Xanadu Live  
- V.A.N. Game: Trippin Through Xanadu

# Core Gameplay Loop

1. Collect resources by clicking and chipping away at the terrain.  
2. Sculpt and flatten land using click-based tools.  
3. Construct buildings such as mind-control towers, utility structures, and other reality-bending architecture.  
4. Upgrade your V.A.N. with functional attachments (tools, weapons, logistics modules).  
5. Use your tools and structures to tame and recruit native creatures.  
6. Recruited creatures automatically gather resources, sculpt land, and build structures.  
7. Manage creature happiness and prevent rebellions that may damage your civilization.  
8. Build entertainment and comfort structures to maintain a thriving utopia (slides, theatres, decorations, etc.).


# Creatures of Xanadu (Milestone 1)

A small set of unique creatures populates the dome. Each has its own recruitment method.

### Matchy Stars  
Hatch from eggs and lay more eggs. Must be struck with the "fly swatter" tool to become recruitable.

More species will be added in future milestones with unique personalities and taming mechanics.

# V.A.N. Customization (Milestone 1)

The Vehicular Actualization Navigator (V.A.N.) serves as the player's mobile home base, resource vacuum, and identity anchor.  
Players can attach upgrades that change both gameplay and appearance. Examples include:

### Initial Upgrades
- Fly Swatter: Swats the area in front of the V.A.N. and may recruit creatures.  
- Super Click: Each click counts as two clicks.

### Customization Vision
Players should be able to transform the V.A.N. into:  
- a dangerous armored rover  
- a friendly psychedelic van  
- a cozy, decorative vehicle  
- a logistics-heavy utility vehicle  

Upgrades visually modify the V.A.N. based on playstyle.

# Buildings (Milestone 1)

### Town Hall  
The central hub of your settlement. Other structures must connect within its radius.

### Imposing Tower  
Large, impressive spires that persuade or influence creatures to join the civ.

### Sleep Pod  
A single rest station for one creature. Lack of sleep reduces happiness and can trigger rebellions.

More buildings will be added later, including entertainment, logistics, and happiness-boosting structures.

# Terrain Sculpting (Milestone 1)

Xanadu uses a Marching Cubes smooth-voxel terrain system with intuitive click-based tools.  
Players can:

- Flatten land  
- Carve shapes  
- Build terrain-based architecture  
- Sculpt the dome into structures instead of relying solely on prefabs  

Terrain volumes can also be designated as functional buildings.  
Example: A carved-out chamber with a bed shape can be tagged as a Sleep Pod without requiring a prefab object.

This system enables high creative freedom while keeping early gameplay approachable.

# Milestone 1 Goals

A playable, self-contained dome prototype including:

- One finite spherical dome (expandable to more domes later).  
- Three to four creature types with distinct taming mechanics.  
- Resource extraction via terrain chipping; the V.A.N. automatically vacuums drops within radius.  
- Terrain-flattening and buildup tools with click-to-edit interactions.  
- Three to four building types.  
- Recruited creatures can gather resources, sculpt terrain, and build structures.  
- A basic happiness system influencing behavior and potential rebellions.

This milestone delivers a complete vertical slice demonstrating terrain sculpting, creature recruitment, V.A.N. progression, and the utopia-building loop.
