# Project Xanadu - The Master Plan aka Game Design Doc

The stately pleasure dome that Kubla Kahn did decree. Based on the public doman poem that was never finished. A fever dream about the perfect world, Utopia.

Potential Names:
* Xanadu Live
* VAN Game: Trippin Through Xanadu

## Core Gameplay Loop:
1. Collect resources (Gold? Crystals? Zoot?) needed to build stuff. Collect stuff by clicking and chipping away.
2. Flatten land by clicking and chipping away.
3. Build structures. (Mind control towers, reality bending stuff.) Build by clicking over and over.
4. Build upgrades to your van that can be attached (armor, fly swatter/weapons to help build and increase your clicking power.)
5. Use your structures and such to tame/recruit the native creatures.
6. The creatures who join Xanadu can collect resources, flatten land, and build structures.
7. If the creatures become unhappy they will rise up and destroy your civ/insite other creatures to rebel.
8. Build structures to increase happiness and make Xanadu a pleasure dome, games, elaborate decoractions, water slides, theatres etc.

## Van Customization:
The V.ehicular A.ctualization N.avigator or VAN will be customizable, build a death machine, or a hippie scooby doo thing, or a cute cozy vehicle with flowers and whatever. As you build upgrades your VAN changes it's aesthetics to whatever kind of things you attach. Add a lot of weapons, your VAN will be fierce and intimidating. Add a lot of communications and other logistical stuff and it will be more cute.

## First Milestone:
* Spherical finite dome of terrain. (Once the demo is beaten the dome will expand or open up new domes. Design the dome system to be arbitrarily large if needed.)
* 3-4 different kinds of creatures, each with it's on way to be tamed (Some will need to be slapped around, some will need to be coaxed in other ways.)
* Resources are spawned in your dome, and you can bring them to the van. (All chipped away resources within a radius of the van get sucked up.)
* Tools for flatening land by clicking. (Cunks of dirt are spawned every time you click, that can be collected and used to fill in holes.)
* Tools for building on flat land by clicking. 3-4 different kinds of buildings (Psy recruitment tower, sleeping pod...)
* Tamed creatures can build/work/flatten terrain/collect resources.
* Citizens (Tamed Creatures) will have happiness meters and if their needs aren't met they get unhappy.
